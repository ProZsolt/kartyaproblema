# CardProblem

I managed to finish the rank calculation. It will return a number, highest means better rank

I created a dump compare algorithm which only compares ranks. It will return equal even if somebody has a pair of two and the other a pair of four. I have the algorithm in my head but run out of time to program it for every rank. 

If I had more time, I would create separate classes for card end ranks to separate out some functionality and store human-readable names

I realized my Ruby is a little bit rusty I mainly played with Go in the previous 1-2 months. Creating the boilerplate took a quite some time. 

 If you send this to somebody else it would be nice to send testing data so the person doesn't have to come up with something on the spot.

All in all, I really enjoyed this challenge.
