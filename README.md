# KartyaProblema


Created a Hand class
It can be initialized with an array of strings. The array should contain 5 strings. The string should be in the following format: [23456789TJQKA][CDHS]. The string represents a card
You can get the rank of the hand with the #rank method it will return the name of the rank
You can compare two hands with the spaceship operator(<=>)

I realized my Ruby is a little bit rusty I mainly played with Go in the previous 1-2 months. Creating the boilerplate took a little bit more time than expected. 

With more time I would add a lot more test cases, maybe a test case generator. Rake task for testing and a git pre-commit hook.

If you send this to somebody else it would be nice to send testing data so the person doesn't have to come up with something on the spot.

All in all, I really enjoyed this challenge.
